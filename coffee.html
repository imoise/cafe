					<b>Vantablack Coffee</b> is a coffee like none other. Named after the recently discovered artificial material,
					<b>Vantablack</b> which is known for being the darkest man-made substance due to the fact it absorbs 99.96% of all light that hits it's surface. 
					The coffee beans used in our coffee were named after the material after being found growing in a cave in the south tropics being almost completely void of sunlight.
					These beans were found to absorb almost all light like <b>Vantablack</b> but with one added effect. One cup of this coffee packs enough caffeine to stay up 3 days and nights!
					That's why <b>Vantablack Coffee</b> is popular among students needing to finish a last minute essay and businessmen who want to finish their paper work in time for the holidays.
					However, we worn this coffee is not for everyone because after those 3 days of energy follows three days of coma like sleep to make up for it. Will you dare to drink the drink known as the
					<i>Devil's Coffee</i>? The choice is yours!
